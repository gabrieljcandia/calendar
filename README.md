# Calendar App

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), this project allows you
to create and edit tasks that are displayed on a Calendar.

You can preview the app [here](https://61887478311dd3e1943ae166--calendar-app-gabriel-candia.netlify.app/).

## Scripts

To start the app in development mode, execute `npm start`.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

To execute the tests from the console, once the app is running in development mode, execute `npm run cy:run`

If you wish to see the actual page interaction while the tests are running, you can do so by executing `npm run cy:open`

The app can be built for production in the `build` by running the command `npm run build`
